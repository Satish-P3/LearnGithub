today i read about pass authentication of github
as i encounterd the problem to clone my git repo
when i enter git clone and repository http link
it was asking me about username and password
even after entering corect password i ws getting error
so today read about it on internet and found ssh key , then
i created it add to my github account .
then again when i tried to clone git repo this time i used ssh link to clone my
repo and it worked excellent , this time it didnt even ask
for my username or password aslo.
